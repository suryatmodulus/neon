//!
//! This module provides centralized handling of threads in the Page Server.
//!
//! We provide a few basic facilities:
//! - A global registry of threads that lists what kind of threads they are, and
//!   which tenant or timeline they are working on
//!
//! - The ability to request a thread to shut down.
//!
//!
//! # How it works?
//!
//! There is a global hashmap of all the threads (`THREADS`). Whenever a new
//! thread is spawned, a PageServerThread entry is added there, and when a
//! thread dies, it removes itself from the hashmap. If you want to kill a
//! thread, you can scan the hashmap to find it.
//!
//! # Thread shutdown
//!
//! To kill a thread, we rely on co-operation from the victim. Each thread is
//! expected to periodically call the `is_shutdown_requested()` function, and
//! if it returns true, exit gracefully. In addition to that, when waiting for
//! the network or other long-running operation, you can use
//! `shutdown_watcher()` function to get a Future that will become ready if
//! the current thread has been requested to shut down. You can use that with
//! Tokio select!(), but note that it relies on thread-local storage, so it
//! will only work with the "current-thread" Tokio runtime!
//!
//!
//! TODO: This would be a good place to also handle panics in a somewhat sane way.
//! Depending on what thread panics, we might want to kill the whole server, or
//! only a single tenant or timeline.
//!
